# CI/CD with Jenkins Pipeline

## What are we doing?
1. Setting up a Jenkins instance running in a Docker container.
2. Creating a traditional Jenkins build in the Jenkins UI.
3. Creating a version of that same build that uses a Jenkins Pipeline typed into the UI.
4. Creating a pipeline script that lives alongside our code in GitHub.
5. Creating a pipeline script that uses Jenkins shared libraries for modularization.
6. Creating a pipeline script that uses some more advanced features of shared libraries.
